Here's a step-by-step guide presented in a tabular format for setting up your Git workflow:

Step	Action	Command/Description	Purpose
1	Initialize Git	git init	Initializes a Git repository in your project directory.
2	Add files to Git	git add .	Adds all files in the current directory to the staging area.
3	Commit files	git commit -m "Initial commit"	Commits the staged files with a message.
4	Create a GitHub repository	Go to GitHub and create a new repository	Creates a remote repository where your code will be stored.
5	Add remote origin	git remote add origin <repository-url>	Links your local repository to the GitHub repository. Replace <repository-url> with your repository URL.
6	Push to GitHub	git push -u origin main	Pushes your code to the main branch on GitHub.
7	Create a new branch	git checkout -b <branch-name>	Creates and switches to a new branch. Replace <branch-name> with the name of your feature branch.
8	Work on your feature	Code on your branch	Develop your feature in the newly created branch.
9	Stage and commit changes	git add . and git commit -m "Feature work"	Stages and commits your changes daily.
10	Push changes to GitHub	git push origin <branch-name>	Pushes your daily changes to the specific branch on GitHub.
11	Start the next day	git pull origin <branch-name>	Syncs the latest changes from your branch to your local machine before starting work.
12	Switch to another branch	git checkout <branch-name>	Switches to another feature branch if needed.
13	Merge changes to main	git checkout main, git merge <branch-name>	Once the feature is complete, merge it into the main branch.
14	Push merged changes to GitHub	git push origin main	Pushes the merged changes to the main branch on GitHub.
Notes:
Replace <branch-name> and <repository-url> with your actual branch name and repository URL.
Make sure to resolve any merge conflicts when pulling the latest code from GitHub.
It's a good practice to regularly sync your branches with main to avoid conflicts later.
This workflow ensures that your work is regularly backed up on GitHub and you can always resume work with the latest code.

To get your branch code on another machine using VS Code, follow these steps:

Step-by-Step Guide
Step	Action	Command/Description	Purpose
1	Clone the repository	git clone <repository-url>	Clones the entire repository to your local machine. Replace <repository-url> with your GitHub repository URL.
2	Open the project in VS Code	Open the cloned directory in VS Code	Opens the cloned project so you can start working.
3	Fetch all branches	git fetch --all	Fetches all the branches from the remote repository.
4	List all branches	git branch -a	Lists all local and remote branches available in the repository.
5	Switch to the desired branch	git checkout <branch-name>	Switches to the branch you want to work on. Replace <branch-name> with the actual branch name.
6	Pull the latest code from the branch	git pull origin <branch-name>	Ensures you have the latest changes from the remote branch.
7	Start working	Begin coding in the selected branch	You are now set to work on the selected branch in VS Code on the new machine.
Additional Notes:
Ensure you have Git installed on the new machine.
If the branch does not exist locally, git checkout <branch-name> will automatically create a local branch tracking the remote branch.
Always pull the latest changes from the branch before starting work to avoid conflicts.
This process allows you to continue working on your branch seamlessly on any machine.
